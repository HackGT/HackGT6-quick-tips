# Contributing Guidelines for Writing Quick Tips
- Assume your audience can use modern devices, but has no explicit CS background
- Short and sweet
- Bullets are your best friend
- Break things down into sections
- Mention references and provide links (in the beginning and the end)
- Provide whitespace, and pictures!
- Template structure should be filled out like `github-cli.md`. Namely, provide an overview, introduce concepts, write a paragraph and provide examples, and close off with further reading. Credit yourself and your org as an author!
- Fork quick tips and open a PR, ping your HackGT point of contact and work with them to get your guide published!
- Feel free to provide an FAQ section at the bottom of the guide if you feel certain concepts don't fit into the rest of the flow.
- You may be inspired by [TreeHack's hackpacks](https://github.com/TreeHacks/hackpack-web-api), which these quick tips were inspired by. Unlike hackpacks, quick tips are designed to not be code packages, but simpler concept explanations.

When in doubt, reach out to HackGT either through your point of contact or at `hello@hack.gt` with the subject "Writing a Quick Tip".
