# Contributing Guidelines for Writing Quick Tips
- Assume your audience can use modern devices, but has no explicit CS background
- Short and sweet
- Bullets are your best friend
- Break things down into sections
- Keep it casual and lighthearted
- Mention references and provide links (in the beginning and the end)


- Template structure should be filled out like `github-cli.md`. Namely, provide an overview, introduce concepts, write a paragraph and provide examples, and close off with further reading. Credit yourself and your org as an author!
- Fork quick tips and open a PR, ping your HackGT point of contact and work with them to get your guide published!
