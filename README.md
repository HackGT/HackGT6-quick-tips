# HackGT6 Quick Tips: The Bear Necessities

🐻 _Forget about your worries and your strife!_

Welcome to HackGT's Quick Tips (and congratulations on your first steps into Wonderland 🎉)! For lengthier, self-contained tutorials, see [TreeHack's Hackerpacks](https://github.com/TreeHacks)

It's easy to feel overwhelmed when you might not even know what you don't know. To help orient you, we've compiled several guides to get you up to speed on how to make a successful hack, regardless of your experience!

Each markdown file in this repo (on this page) will walk you through a useful fundamental concept. The guides will provide additional resources for further reading at your leisure.

💻 Happy hacking!

_If you want to see a guide we're missing or are having trouble with any of the steps (i.e. installation errors) in our guides, open an issue and we'll get back to you as soon as we can!_
